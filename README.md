# Img2Music

Img2Music is a network that generates genre-specific music snippets from the features of an input album cover image.

This submission contains 3 files:
- `Model_Showcase.ipynb` - Demonstrates the model in action, loads pre-trained weights, no training required.
- `Full_Training_Pipeline.ipynb` - Code for obtaining weights for each part of the model. Estimated training time using A100 gpu: ~2-3 hrs.
- `report.pdf` - Concisely describes project goals, methodologies, results & interpretations, and contains all references.

I recommend starting with `Model_Showcase.ipynb` or the report to understand the model itself and the context of this project.
`Full_Training_Pipeline.ipynb` showcases all of the code and approaches mentioned in the report.

**Note** that the `.ipynb` notebooks designed to run in Google Colab.
